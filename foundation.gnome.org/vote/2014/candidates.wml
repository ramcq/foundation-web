    <h1>Candidates for the GNOME Foundation 2014 Elections</h1>

    <p>
      Below you will find a list of candidates who are running for the
      GNOME Foundation Board of Directors. A short summary statement from
      each candidate and a link to their full candidacy announcement is
      provided to help you learn more about them. We encourage all voters
      to read the full candidacy statements and related discussions on
      <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/">foundation-list&#64;gnome&#46;org</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      When deciding who you should vote for, please carefully consider
      the various tasks the Board of Directors must perform. This
      <a href="../overview.html">overview</a> may be helpful. Keep in mind that
      the board will make a number of important decisions and will also have to
      perform many tasks which require a significant amount of time and effort
      and the ability to work and communicate with other people, companies, and
      the media. The board of directors will represent GNOME to companies and
      the world in a very real way. It is a good idea to strive for a
      well-balanced board consisting of people with various backgrounds,
      skills, and perspectives.
    </p>

                <blockquote>
                    I have served on the Board of the GNOME Foundation for two years now and as I
                    enjoy my duties I would like to continue doing so. I promote Free Software and
                    GNOME wherever I can. I am regularly speaking at conferences and making contact
                    with new users, contributors, or other organisations that help us to advance
                    GNOME, spread the word about Free Software, and ultimately make the world a
                    better place.

                    I am running for the Board because I think I can be an asset in making GNOME
                    better. I think we need to restructure our Friends of GNOME programme to make it
                    cost us much less time or upgrade our Bugzilla instance. If elected, I would try
                    to steer resources towards those goals.

                    I want to announce my candidacy for the GNOME Board of Directors. I
                    have contributing as part of the Engagement Team since 2010, recently
                    I  have been involved with the GUADEC 2015 Gothenburg bid and the
                    Annual Report.

                    I think that free software never have more important then now and if
                    we as a community can get together and do the necessary work the
                    greatest future of GNOME lay ahead of us.

                    I have two years of experience of being on the non-for profit FSCONS
                    board (FSCONS, the free software conference in Gothenburg that Karen
                    keynoted last year). More info about me (including occupation) can be

                    help bring continuity to the board (Stormy was incredibly helpful on
                    the board when I started as ED). Also, as a lawyer I sometimes have an
                    additionally useful perspective. I'm still doing volunteer work for
                    GNOME both as pro bono counsel and as a volunteer on nonlegal matters
                    for GNOME. I've been helping with fundraising, collecting on
                    outstanding invoices and generally wherever I can.

                    This is the first time i have been running for any 
                    election (you can't win over your friends) Since 
                    last few years, i have been talking at various 
                    conferences making awareness about Free Software and 
                    GNOME, input methods and how one can make money from 
                    free software.

                    The reason i would like to run for this election is 
                    because I think would be the right person to promote 
                    GNOME specially in Asian region. If I get elected,i 
                    would try to have more hackfests in Asia region and 
                    try to raise fund for GNOME.

                    direction. It is my opinion that GNOME has strode too far towards a

                    now, GNOME is, in my opinion too beholden to a small handful of large

                    users in preference to them. The end result being that GNOME has lost

                    further the goals of GNOME and will help the membership, especially
