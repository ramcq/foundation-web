    <h1>Candidates for the GNOME Foundation 2021 Elections</h1>

    <p>
      Below you find the list of candidates running for the
      GNOME Foundation Board of Directors in 2021. We encourage everyone
      to check the candidates' full candidacy statements, and follow related 
      discussions on <a href="https://discourse.gnome.org/c/community/elections-and-referendums/336">Discourse</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      When deciding who to vote for, please consider
      the various tasks under the responsibility of the Board of Directors. This
      <a href="../overview.html">overview</a> might be helpful. The board makes 
      a number of important decisions and performs many tasks which require time,
      effort and the ability to work and communicate with others. The Board of 
      Directors will represent GNOME to companies and the world. It is a good idea
      to strive for a well-balanced Board consisting of people with various backgrounds,
      skills, and perspectives.
    </p>

    <h2>Candidates for the GNOME Foundation Board of Directors</h2>

I am announcing my candidacy for the GNOME Foundation Board of Directors. You will find below the key points of who am I in the GNOME Community and what I would like to help with. For the full length wall of text, please have a look at the blog post announcing my candidacy.

Like many, I started my involvement in the GNOME community as an end-user. I eventually started helping with translations. For this activity I have regularily been chasing maintainers for string freezes, or to ask for explanations when strings didnâ€™t make sense for me.
This helped me to blend in, meet the more general community, and finally take interest in higher level issues such as our infamous chat platforms split, or co-organising the GSoC 2021. I have a very strong interest in people, groups of them, ethics, how software impacts them all and how proper governance can help to achieve goals.

As a member of the board, I would focus on our internal and external communication, where we have a lot of room for improvement. Attracting new contributors is essential: our public face and the messages we send must resonate with their values. Once they are here, the bottleneck for their contributions must be removed: what they can do and where to do it must be clear, how to do it as well. While getting new recruits is extremely important for a project to stay in good shape, sustainability cannot be achieved without taking care of long time contributors.

I am strongly biased towards think for a bit but start doing quickly, ask around how it impacted others, and adapt rather than overthinking. I believe KPIs are necessarily biased and get circumvented all the time. Human interactions is how you measure success.

As the head of digital identity of a large organisation, I am experienced in projects aiming to lower the friction for customer onboarding. Quite counter-intuitively, many parallels can be drawn between corporate customers and non-profit contributors.

Open-source software communities used to despise designers and thought they knew better. Now we welcome them and see the positive impact they have. A second mentality change needs happen: we must allow the persons who are good at hyping others to help.

I'm announcing my candidacy for the GNOME Foundation board of directors election.

Currently, I am the lead of the GNOME Asia committee [1]. If I am elected to be a board member, it enables me to share my opinions and experiences in & from the Asia community with the board directly.

I am a Hongkonger who contributes to the open source and GNOME community for 20+ and 10 years. I grew up between the western and eastern cultures in the British colony. I embrace democracy and freedom which are the important values in the western. It is thankful that the open source community provides many different software tools, and I am always happy to contribute back to the community and the society with my experience, mindset, and knowledge in technology.

For the GNOME community, I organised the GNOME Asia Summit 2012 in Hong Kong with our local team. After the summit, I join the GNOME Asia committee in 2012 to help the committee to call for hosts every year, and gives advice and supports to the local teams.

For the open source community, I established Hong Kong Linux User Group (HKLUG) and Open Source Hong Kong (OSHK) in 1997 and 2006. Thanks to the success of the GNOME Asia Summit in Hong Kong, I established the Hong Kong Open Source Conference and PyCon Hong Kong in 2013 and 2015. Since 2011, I also travel to overseas open source conferences every year and meet with open source communities in the various cities in Asia, and travel to Bay Area, I built some connections with some Asia communities and global open source project communities.

Currently, I am the President of OSHK and the conference chair of PyCon HK. I am also a Mozilla Rep and a contributing member of the Python Software Foundation. I was a founder and director of HK Creative Open Technology Association which provides organisational support to our open source community works locally.

In my career, I own my IT service company in the 00s for 6 years and then become a freelancer for 10+ years. I learned and gained business operation experience.

I think communication is important to the GNOME community, and I hope my business operation experience and almost 20 conference organising experiences can help GNOME,  a new role can enable me to help. You may also read my interview on the GNOME blog to know more about me and my thoughts on GNOME.

I am offering my candidacy to serve on the Foundation Board again.

I was a director/president for some years before, while we had no ED, and what I bring to the table today is my marketing, strategy & finance perspective. I am excited about the direction the GNOME Foundation is taking and would be happy to participate in its governance. I understand this is a new context compared to previous year and this comes with its own set of challenges.

I'm keeping this pitch short & simple, if you would like to learn more about me, please have a look at the <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/JeffFortin">following link</a>.
