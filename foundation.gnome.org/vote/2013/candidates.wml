    <h1>Candidates for the GNOME Foundation 2013 Elections</h1>

    <p>
      Below you will find a list of candidates who are running for the
      GNOME Foundation Board of Directors. A short summary statement from
      each candidate and a link to their full candidacy announcement is
      provided to help you learn more about them. We encourage all voters
      to read the full candidacy statements and related discussions on
      <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/">foundation-list&#64;gnome&#46;org</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      When deciding who you should vote for, please carefully consider
      the various tasks the Board of Directors must perform. This
      <a href="../overview.html">overview</a> may be helpful. Keep in mind that
      the board will make a number of important decisions and will also have to
      perform many tasks which require a significant amount of time and effort
      and the ability to work and communicate with other people, companies, and
      the media. The board of directors will represent GNOME to companies and
      the world in a very real way. It is a good idea to strive for a
      well-balanced board consisting of people with various backgrounds,
      skills, and perspectives.
    </p>

                    I am passionate about Free Software and GNOME and advancing it satisfies 
                    me. I enjoyed the work during the last year and I hope to be able to 
                    continue doing so. Within the last year I helped revamping our bylaws 
                    and then got more and more involved in making our Friends of GNOME 
                    program more smooth. This is still ongoing and I also initiated contact 
                    with a European entity to collect funds for us to make us more 
                    indepedent from Paypal. Being on the board makes finishing that a lot 
                    easier.

                     I've been involved in GNOME since 2005 doing a variety of things. Mainly graphics and websites. I served on the Board of Directors between 2010 and 2011. If I get elected, I want to primary focus on two things. Fundraising and getting new developers. I want to make our fundraising campaigns really effective and make it as fun and rewarding to make donations to the GNOME project as possible. I'm happy that we have now been able to release the new, more effective Friends of GNOME site, but there is more we can do in this area. For new developers, I'm happy with the outcome of the GSOC and WOP's we've been running, and we should continue to do these, but I also want to make sure the inroads for potential contributors who visit our website is as clear as possible. I'm sure I will get very much tangled up in whatever pops up during the way for the board (as things tend to do), but I will keep these two items in mind as goals for the term.

                    to be done evenings, weekends, and holidays as a community contributor.
                    Joining Igalia in October 2011 has made it possible for GNOME
                    Accessibility to become part of my DayJob, which in turn has given me a
                    very precious commodity: spare time. I would like to spend some of that
                    time serving on the GNOME Foundation Board.

                    to a new treasurer. The treasurer role is inevitably difficult for

                    can smoothly transition year to year, because handling GNOME's money
                    is one of the most important things the Foundation does.

                Currently, I spend nearly 50% of my working time on GNOME-related projects, thanks to Collabora. I also spend a lot of my time working on deploying Zeitgeist into some smaller projects like Gedit (the dashboard plugin), which greatly benefited from design collaboration with Hylke Bons and Garrett LeSage.

                Sometimes misunderstandings and miscommunication happen in the community, especially between different teams who may share similar goals but different viewpoints. This blurred vision was evident in mailing-lists over the past few weeks. (Thankfully Olav did a great job moderating the lists to not let it get too out-of-hand.)
