    <h1>Verification of the GNOME Foundation Anonymous Voting Referendum Results</h1>

    <p>
      To run the vote counting scripts, you need to download this archive:
      <a href="2004-10-verif.tar.gz">2004-10-verif.tar.gz</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please note that you need make, wget, perl and python to run the
      verification.
    </p>

    <p>
      We advise every member to download the verification software and to
      verify that his/her counted vote is indeed the vote he/she sent
    </p>

    <h2>Running the verification</h2>

    <p>
      Here are the steps to obtain the results:
    </p>
    
    <pre>$ tar zxvf 2004-10-verif.tar.gz</pre>
    <pre>$ cd 2004-10-verif</pre>
    <pre>$ make</pre>


    <p>
      The results should be in results.txt. A list of errors will be generated
      at the top of the output. The final tallies will be at the bottom.
    </p>

    <h2>The verification software</h2>

    <p>
      With this verification software, you should get the same results that the
      one posted by the GNOME Foundation Membership and Elections Committee.
      You may want to verify the validity of this software, so here are some
      hints to help you:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        look at registered-voters.txt: this file contains the list of voters.
        You can match it with the <a href="voters.html">official list</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        look at vote-archives.diff: this file contains all the modifications
        that are made to the original vote archives to make the script work
        without any problem. The main modifications are due to UTF-8 problems
        or some misplaced characters. Some spams are also removed from the
        archives.
      </li>
      <li>
        look at vote-counter.py: this script does the counting. You can read
        its code if you want to search for serious bugs that may alter the
        results.
      </li>
    </ul>
