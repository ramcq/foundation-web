    <h1>GNOME Directors determine the length of the term of the next board Referendum</h1>

    <p>
      Any member of the GNOME Foundation can suggest a referendum. To be
      accepted, a request for a referendum must be endorsed by 10% of the
      Membership. The overall referendum process is overseen by the
      Membership and Elections Committee, which can be reached at <a
      href="mailto:elections&#64;gnome&#46;org">elections&#64;gnome&#46;org</a>.
