    <h1>Candidates for the GNOME Foundation 2000 Elections</h1>
    <p>Oct 26, 2000</p>

    <p>
      Below you will find a list of candidates who are running for the GNOME
      Foundation Board of Directors. A short summary statement from each
      candidate and a link to their full candidacy announcement is provided to
      help you learn more about them. We encourage all voters to read the full
      candidacy statements and related discussions on <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/">foundation-list&#64;gnome&#46;org</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      When deciding who you should vote for, please carefully consider the
      various tasks the Board of Directors must perform. This <a
      href="../overview.html">overview</a> may be helpful. Keep in mind that
      the board will make a number of important decisions and will also have to
      perform many tasks which require a significant amount of time and effort
      and the ability to work and communicate with other people, companies, and
      the media. The board of directors will represent GNOME to companies and
      the world in a very real way. It is a good idea to strive for a
      well-balanced board consisting of people with various backgrounds,
      skills, and perspectives.

    <h2>Candidates for the GNOME Foundation Board of Directors</h2>

    <p>
      1. MARTIN BAULIG. &quot;I'm a 24 years old student and working for SuSE
      on GNOME. * Gnome-libs 2.0 - it is very important to be attractive to
      developers of other Free Software, to have well-designed, well-documented
      APIs which are a pleasure to use. * GNOME is official part of the GNU
      Project and it becomes more and more important to know where we're coming
      from and to stick to our roots. * Doing Talks and Shows in Germany.&quot;

      2. CHEMA CELORIO. &quot;I have been doing unpaid work for GNOME on a
      daily basis for the last year. Mainly in gedit and gnome-print. And I
      LOVE IT ! I have developed very good personal relationships with
      different members of the GNOME community. I want GNOME to remain a
      community effort, a fun project to work on and a project that has healthy
      relationships with the companies it interacts with. I want GNOME to
      continue being widely open to new contributors.&quot; Full statement at

    <p>
      3. KENNETH CHRISTIANSEN. &quot;I will work on making Gnome work better
      with internationalization, so that people in non-english speaking
      countries can start using Gnome for real. This requires a lot of work,
      and everyone in the Gnome community will have to settle on some common
      guidelines for dealing with this. Due to my long involvement in Gnome
      Translation Project I have quite some idea of how we can do this, and is
      personally interested in working hard for archieving this. No corporate
      affiliations!&quot; Full statement at <a

      4. RHETT CREIGHTON. &quot;I am a Jr. undergrad student at MIT, and I'd
      like to see Gnome succeed, like all of you. If I win, I don't promise to
      do a better job than most of you could do, but I do promise to do it
      while eating a truckload of bananas. Really, I want to use the position
      to impress chicks, I mean, help guide the direction of Gnome toward what
      I think will make it the ideal computing platform.&quot;. Full statement

      5. BART DECREM. &quot;As the Foundation's coordinator, I have helped
      build a structure that maintains the power in GNOME with the hackers
      while providing ways for corporate partners to have their voice heard. I
      see my role as a facilitator who ensures that the foundation will
      function in an open and effective manner, and to help bring corporate
      partners on board who will bring GNOME to many millions of new users
      without violating our principles.&quot; Affiliated with Eazel. Full

    <p>
      8. JUANTOMAS GARCIA. Spent last three years promoting GNU/Linux
      and free software in Spain, to companies and the Spanish government,
      among others: &quot;GNOME needs more than code, it needs lots of
      input and work on and over it... The board needs to have a real
      criticism from the inside that's brave enough to point out whatever
      is wrong with GNOME... I'm Spanish and European (and very proud of
      it) and Europe needs more GNOME action indeed.&quot; Full statement

      Consortium, W3C, IETF. Worked on the GNOME Foundation announcement
      and startup this summer: &quot;In short, I'd really like to see open

      applications (both open source and commercial) are another. We MUST
      avoid the GUI wars that crippled UNIX desktops in the 1980's to
      change the world.&quot; Affiliated with Compaq. Full statement at

      glibwwww, gnumeric guile plugin; has given numerous speeches
      advocating GNOME and Free Software in Canada, USA, and Mexico: &quot;I
      am from Mexico so I can represent the Hispanoamerican region... I do
      not work for any corporation and I wish to represent no other
      interests besides GNOME and those of Free Software. I do believe in
      freedom and equality among all of the members of the GNOME
      community.&quot; Full statement at

      29. ARLO ROSE. &quot;I'm the Human Interface lead for the Nautilus
      project, and am in the process of forming a GNOME HI group that will
      raise community and developer awareness of usability and visual
      issues with GNOME projects. I'd like to have a seat on the board so I
      can strengthen awareness for good human interface design, raise the
      standards for the GNOME desktop look and feel, and act as the voice
      for usability issues in our community.&quot; Affiliated with Eazel.

      30. JOE SHAW. &quot;I have been involved in the GNOME community
      from the start, contributing to several modules. I'm the maintainer
      of Achtung and author of Helix's installer and updater. I'm outspoken
      against corporate dominance of the foundation, but know they need to
      be well-represented. I feel that the board needs a good
      hacker/non-hacker mix. GNOME needs to become more aggressive with its
      conference/show policies and GNOME 2.0 development needs to take hold
      now.&quot; Affiliated with Helix Code. Full statement at

      31. MACIEJ STACHOWIAK. &quot;While I have hacked on many free
      software projects (most notably Nautilus, see
      <a href="http://advogato.org/person/mjs">http://advogato.org/person/mjs</a>
      for others), I think the strongest qualifications I have are
      non-technical. First, I have a talent for making processes more
      transparent, as with my work on GNOME 1.4 coordiation. Second, I am
      good at communicating both inside and outside the project. Finally, I
      believe in free software, openness and honesty, and I'm willing to
      stand up to anyone for these beliefs.&quot; Affiliated with Eazel.

      32. OWEN TAYLOR. &quot;As co-maintainer of GTK+ and the designer
      of Pango, I think I'm in a good position to handle coordination of
      GNOME with these important core technologies. I also have a strong
      interest in language bindings and component technology, as
      represented by the CORBA::ORBit Perl bindings for CORBA. If I am
      elected to the board, I will continue to push GNOME in the areas of
      internationalization and an easy-to-use development platform.&quot;

      33. DANIEL VEILLARD. &quot;I am French, a long time Gnomer and
      Linux addict, the maintainer of libxml and rpmfind. I work for W3C
      and I am used to non-profit organizations and the negociations needed
      to get a group to reach consensus. I will focuse on the reuse of
      standards, internationalization and keeping trust relationship at an
      individual level. I think those are needed to keep hacking on gnome
      fun and getting acceptance in new communities.&quot; Affiliated with
      W3C. Full candidacy statement at
