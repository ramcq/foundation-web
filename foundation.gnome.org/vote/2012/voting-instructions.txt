   Vote token:

The election has 4 steps - first, you must identify yourself using the 
voting token above. Then select your preferred candidates in order of 
preference. A third step will show you your choice, and ask you to 
confirm or return to the previous step. Finally, after confirming your 
choice, a unique identifier will be given to you which will allow you to 
verify after the election that your vote was counted correctly. To ensure 
anonymity, no link will be kept between this token and your identifiers, 
so please keep this token safe. Once you have voted, you will not be able 
to vote again.

Thank you for your vote!
