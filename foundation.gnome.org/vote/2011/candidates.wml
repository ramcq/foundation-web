    <h1>Candidates for the GNOME Foundation 2011 Elections</h1>
    <div id="content">

    <p>
      Below you will find a list of candidates who are running for the
      GNOME Foundation Board of Directors. A short summary statement from
      each candidate and a link to their full candidacy announcement is
      provided to help you learn more about them. We encourage all voters
      to read the full candidacy statements and related discussions on
      <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/">foundation-list&#64;gnome&#46;org</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      When deciding who you should vote for, please carefully consider
      the various tasks the Board of Directors must perform. This
      <a href="../overview.html">overview</a> may be helpful. Keep in mind that
      the board will make a number of important decisions and will also have to
      perform many tasks which require a significant amount of time and effort
      and the ability to work and communicate with other people, companies, and
      the media. The board of directors will represent GNOME to companies and
      the world in a very real way. It is a good idea to strive for a
      well-balanced board consisting of people with various backgrounds,
      skills, and perspectives.

                    I started my GNOME adventure around three years ago while I was working 
                    on uploading GNOME 2.28 into Debian Unstable as a member of the awesome 
                    Debian’s GNOME Team.

                    After a few months I decided to apply to join the GNOME Foundation and on the
                    12th of November ’09 I had the great announcement that my application was accepted. 
                    During that period both the GNOME Foundation Membership Committee and the
                    Accounts Team weren’t having good times , the queues were huge, most of the members
                    were inactive and didn’t have enough time to cover all the items that were coming in.
                    I decided to start contributing and time by time I cleaned up the whole queues [1], updating 
                    team’s Wiki pages, setting up meetings and discussions to renew our guidelines and policies.
                    I am proud to say that within two years both the Membership Committee and the Accounts
                    Team are on top of the requests, everything is processed in a timely manner and finally this
                    is no more a bottleneck like it was in the past.

                    Within 4 years GNOME.Asia committee has been growing from organizing an annual conference to running different projects.

                   I don't have a grand plan or great thoughts to offer so feel free to
consider this a weak application, but with the great momentum that we
received by the release of GNOME 3.0 my main motivation is to help
pushing outreach and motivate more people to contribute and get
involved. Concretely this means "restarting" the gnome-love initiative
(Sri had some great ideas that I'd love to steal) and a better outreach
to downstream communities (e.g. with regard to translation upstreaming).
Plus sometimes I would have prefered to see more transparency in GNOME
with regard to decision making on our sometimes bumpy way to GNOME 3.0
so one task will be to find ways to facilitate.
