      </li>
      <li>
        Any eligible voter is eligible to be elected to the Board of Directors.
        To announce your candidacy, send a message to
        <a href="https://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-announce/">foundation-announce&#64;gnome&#46;org</a>
        with your full name, e-mail, corporate affiliation (if any), and a

        All discussion related to the elections should be held on
        <a href="https://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/">foundation-list&#64;gnome&#46;org</a>.
        Members are invited to ask questions to one or all candidates on that
        list.
      </li>
      <li>
      	Instructions explaining how to vote will be sent via e-mail to all
      	eligible voters on

      <li>
        Votes will be held confidential during the elections, but an 
        anonymized archive of all submitted votes will be made publicly 
        accessible at its conclusion.
      </li>
      <li>
        The GNOME Foundation Membership and Elections Committee is
        responsible for counting the votes.
        The committee serves at the pleasure of the GNOME Board of Directors
        as per Section 9.1 of the bylaws.

	The 7 candidates voted for most as counted by a <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/2009-March/msg00012.html">single transferable
	vote system</a> will be elected, except that no more than two
	individuals affiliated with any one corporation may be elected. Should
	more than two of the top seven vote-getters be affiliated with the
	same company, only the two with the most votes will be considered
	elected. For a full definition of corporate affiliation, see the
	<a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Foundation/Charter">GNOME Foundation charter</a>.
      </li>
      <li>

        Committee will schedule run-off elections as soon as possible. 
      </li>
      <li>
        The Elections Committee will announce preliminary results as soon as

      <li>
        Any eligible voter may challenge the preliminary results by e-mailing

        to any challenge shall be final. Once any challenges have been
        resolved, the Elections Committee shall announce the final results.
      </li>
      <li>
        Any questions regarding these procedures should be directed to the
        Elections Committee by e-mail to <a
