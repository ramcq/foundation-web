    <h1>Elections: Overview of the Board of Directors</h1>

    <h2>GNOME Foundation Overview</h2>

    <p>
      The GNOME Foundation will work to further the goal of the GNOME project:
      to create a computing platform for use by the general public that is
      completely free software.
    </p>

    <p>
      To achieve this goal, the Foundation will coordinate releases of GNOME
      and determine which projects are part of GNOME. The Foundation will act
      as an official voice for the GNOME project, providing a means of
      communication with the press and with commercial and noncommercial
      organizations interested in GNOME software. The foundation may produce
      educational materials and documentation to help the public learn about
      GNOME software. In addition, it may sponsor GNOME-related technical
      conferences, represent GNOME at relevant conferences sponsored by others,
      help create technical standards for the project and promote the use and
      development of GNOME software.
    </p>

    <h2>Partial List of Tasks of the Board of Directors</h2>

    <p>
      The Board of Directors must perform a broad set of both technical and
      non-technical tasks including:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Help set overall direction for GNOME.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Identify and resolve problems in GNOME. Identify weak points and
          opportunities for improvement and work toward improving GNOME in
          these areas.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Identify areas in which GNOME needs organizational improvement and
          appoint committees or individuals to work on these areas. Work with
          and help these teams to ensure the projects move forward succesfully.
          Some common examples are the release team, GUADEC organizing
          committee, membership and elections committee, and the fundraising
          committee.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Identify areas where GNOME needs improvements in policy, draft new
          policies, and go through revision and concensus-building of the
          policies with the GNOME community and Board. Some common examples
          include the GNOME Foundation charter, the membership policy, the
          GNOME accounts policy, and the software license policy.
        </p>
      </li>

        </p>
      </li>

        <p>Arbitrate technical disputes between maintainers.</p>

      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Diversity of the Board of Directors</h2>

    <p>
      The Board of Directors should reflect the diversity of the GNOME project,
      including leaders of the core GNOME technologies, volunteer contributors
      as well as representatives of companies which are making major
      contributions to GNOME, individuals from various geographic regions, and
      representatives of other aspects of GNOME. The Board is tasked with
      addressing a diverse set of problems and challenges and will function
      best if the Board members are equally diverse in their skill set and
      expertise.
