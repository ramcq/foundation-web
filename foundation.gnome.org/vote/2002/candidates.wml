    <h1>Candidates for the GNOME Foundation 2002 Elections</h1>

    <p>
      Below you will find a list of candidates who are running for the
      GNOME Foundation Board of Directors. A short summary statement from
      each candidate and a link to their full candidacy announcement is
      provided to help you learn more about them. We encourage all voters
      to read the full candidacy statements and related discussions on
      <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/">foundation-list&#64;gnome&#46;org</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      When deciding who you should vote for, please carefully consider
      the various tasks the Board of Directors must perform. This
      <a href="../overview.html">overview</a> may be helpful. Keep in mind that
      the board will make a number of important decisions and will also have to
      perform many tasks which require a significant amount of time and effort
      and the ability to work and communicate with other people, companies, and
      the media. The board of directors will represent GNOME to companies and
      the world in a very real way. It is a good idea to strive for a
      well-balanced board consisting of people with various backgrounds,
      skills, and perspectives.
    </p>

    <h2>Candidates for the GNOME Foundation Board of Directors</h2>

    <p>1. MARTIN SEVIOR<br />
      &quot;
      Now that the push for corporate desktop is on in earnest I believe I can
      help the GNOME community of volunteer hackers feel empowered by
      providing a genuinely independent voice on the Board. I can do this
      because I have no financial stake in any company. I contribute to
      AbiWord and GNOME for the love of hacking and the desire to be part of
      the project to make the World's best desktop.

      &quot;
      I've been working for GNOME since years before there was a GNOME. In
      1983, while formulating plans for the GNU operating system, I decided
      it should include a window system. After two desktop initiatives that
      didn't pan out, I found Miguel, who launched our third desktop
      project--GNOME.
      <br />
      As president of the Free Software Foundation and Chief GNUisance of
      the GNU Project, I have had years of experience working with
      contributors both individual and corporate.

      Have been an active contributor to the free software movement
      since 1992.
      <br />
      Started the GNOME project when various freedom issues arised
      that would threaten the future of a fully free system.
      <br />
      I am one of the founders of Ximian, one of the GNOME
      companies, where we employ around 40 GNOME hackers that
      develop free software.
      <br />

      &quot;
      I am active not only in the accessibility project work,
      but also am actively working with the groups doing Mozilla,
      OpenOffice, and Java integration with GNOME. My goals for GNOME:
      a great developer platform, a complete user desktop environment
      that is not only free but fully accessible to everyone.
      I am a also Sun Microsystems employee, but would serve as an
      "individual contributor" and always keep the "big picture" for GNOME
      paramount.

      &quot;
      I'm standing as an independant, experienced committee worker with the
      international and democratic interests of GNOME as my prime concerns,
      along with transparent and accessible board activity. Having been
      involved in GNOME for two years working with the membership committee,
      and with a great deal of experience in similar roles I feel I have a
      wide view of GNOME's goals and the capabilities and time to serve as an
      effective board member.

      I've been a GNOME developer for more than 2 years now, starting as an
      independant application developer, and finding myself more and more
      involved in work on the core desktop.
      <br />
      I have never before been part of such a board, but I understand the
      requisites for such a position, and will do everything to represent
      the people voting for me.

      I am French, long time Gnomer and Linux addict, maintainer of
      libxml, libxslt and rpmfind. I served on the Gnome Board for two
      years and I am used to non-profit organizations and the negociations
      needed to reach consensus in a group. I will focuse on the reuse
      of standards, internationalization and keeping trust relationship at an
      individual level. I think those are needed to keep hacking on Gnome fun
      and getting acceptance in new communities. Growing the foundation to
      get acceptance by program developpers is the next challenge of the Board.

      I am passionate about GNOME and Free Software, and have committed a large

      magic. This year my primary contribution to GNOME was leadership of the
      Release Team to help our hackers pull off the amazing GNOME 2.0 release.
      I will work to build upon GNOME's contributor base, maintain our casual,
      personal community, ensure a transparently operated Foundation, and to
      promote our project and achievements aggressively.

      &quot;
      I'm announcing myself as a candidate for the 2002 elections of the
      GNOME Foundation board of directors.
      <br />
      The largest value I bring to Gnome is one of perspective to the operation
      of a number of different styles of organizations. Specifically, GNOME
      needs to continue to be open to contributions of all sorts, whether code,
      or translations, or web work, to UI design and graphics, to name a few.
      <br />
      While I don't currently write Gnome code itself, I do hack on the X Window
      System, as I have for a long time; most recently on the RandR extension.
      I've been on the Gnome board the last two years.

      &quot;
      To date, the GNOME foundation has failed to be of any substantial
      benefit to the GNOME project. We are, however, reaching a level of
      momentum and organization at which the foundation can have a big
      impact. What we lack is resources: funds to subsidize in-person events,
      to fly people to conferences, to support our hardware and
      infrastructural needs, to promote the project, and to provide equipment
      to hackers who need it. I served as co-chair of the board this last
      year and organized the 90-person Boston GNOME Summit in July. If
      elected this year, my focus will be on ensuring that GNOME has the
      resources it needs to succeed.

      including GTK+, control-center, gmc, nautilus, gnome-libs, and most
      importantly, gfloppy. I also do a number of sysadmin tasks, and help

      GNOME Foundation needs the combined efforts of hackers and non-hackers.
      Since I first worked with GNOME four years ago, getting machines and
      setting up booths and presentations, the developer community and user
      base has grown tremendously.
      <br />
      My contribution is to build bridges and obtain resources needed for
      GNOME to successfully continue its growth. Working with the GNOME

      researching the way users do their jobs and providing that data to the

      communicate, and helping said persons to organize themselves so a real

      This spring, I became a Mono hacker and since then, I've been hacking on
      the compiler and the new Mono Debugger.
      <br />
      As an European guy and Mono hacker, my main focus is helping GNOME
      moving forward in Europe and integrating GNOME and Mono nicely so that
      people can quickly and easily design their coolest GNOME apps with Mono.

      facilitating and attacking problems from a high level. I would like to
      help the GNOME project grow further by encouraging the use of GEP, help
      get documentation complete, and establish more desktop standards. I've
      had experience in leading a diverse engineering team, worked on projects

      We lack complete developer's documentation for our 2.0 platform. The

      want to work with the different developers of GNOME libraries to ensure
      that their code has proper documentation. Also, I want to help in
      coordination between the GNOME and OpenOffice.org teams --- OO.o needs
      to integrate well into the GNOME environment, and they may also be able
      to use some of our cool technologies to avoid duplicated work.
