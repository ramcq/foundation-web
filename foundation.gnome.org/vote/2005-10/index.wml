    <h1>GNOME Foundation Reducing Board Size Referendum</h1>

    <p>
      Any member of the GNOME Foundation can suggest a referendum. To be
      accepted, a request for a referendum must be endorsed by 10% of the
      Membership. The overall referendum process is overseen by the
      Membership and Elections Committee, which can be reached at <a
      href="mailto:elections&#64;gnome&#46;org">elections&#64;gnome&#46;org</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In September 2005, some Foundation members discussed a possible reduction
      of size of the GNOME Foundation board of directors. The discussion took
      place on <a
      href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/">foundation-list&#64;gnome&#46;org</a>.
      After much discussion, a petition was made to request a referendum. <a
      href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/2005-October/msg00010.html">More
      than 10% of the Membership</a> signed the petition.
    </p>
