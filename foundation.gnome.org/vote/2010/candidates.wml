    <h1>Candidates for the GNOME Foundation 2010 Elections</h1>
    <div id="content">

    <p>
      Below you will find a list of candidates who are running for the
      GNOME Foundation Board of Directors. A short summary statement from
      each candidate and a link to their full candidacy announcement is
      provided to help you learn more about them. We encourage all voters
      to read the full candidacy statements and related discussions on
      <a href="http://live.gnome.org/FoundationBoard/Elections2010/">Foundation Board Elections 2010</a>
      and <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/">foundation-list&#64;gnome&#46;org</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      When deciding who you should vote for, please carefully consider
      the various tasks the Board of Directors must perform. This
      <a href="../overview.html">overview</a> may be helpful. Keep in mind that
      the board will make a number of important decisions and will also have to
      perform many tasks which require a significant amount of time and effort
      and the ability to work and communicate with other people, companies, and
      the media. The board of directors will represent GNOME to companies and
      the world in a very real way. It is a good idea to strive for a
      well-balanced board consisting of people with various backgrounds,
      skills, and perspectives.

well.

    <blockquote>
The GNOME Project has allowed me to take my first steps into the world
of collaborative projects and long nights of translation sprints. Due
to my open minded attitude, I have been able to get involved in many
different projects and work with a great number of interesting people.

My passion is in the community aspect of these projects and how to
better integrate new comers and volunteers with the rest of the
community. I am also extremely interested in how we, the open source
community as a whole, can leverage this immense pool of ideas and
projects, and use it to the benefit of all.

If elected to the board, I will bring in my experience of building
communities and guiding/enabling users to become more active in the
GNOME Project. After all, the GNOME Project IS about people! I will
also push to make accessibility a high priority for the project.
