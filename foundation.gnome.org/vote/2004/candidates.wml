    <h1>Candidates for the GNOME Foundation 2004 Elections</h1>

    <p>
      Below you will find a list of candidates who are running for the
      GNOME Foundation Board of Directors. A short summary statement from
      each candidate and a link to their full candidacy announcement is
      provided to help you learn more about them. We encourage all voters
      to read the full candidacy statements and related discussions on
      <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/">foundation-list&#64;gnome&#46;org</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      When deciding who you should vote for, please carefully consider
      the various tasks the Board of Directors must perform. This
      <a href="../overview.html">overview</a> may be helpful. Keep in mind that
      the board will make a number of important decisions and will also have to
      perform many tasks which require a significant amount of time and effort
      and the ability to work and communicate with other people, companies, and
      the media. The board of directors will represent GNOME to companies and
      the world in a very real way. It is a good idea to strive for a
      well-balanced board consisting of people with various backgrounds,
      skills, and perspectives.
    </p>

    <p>
      Additional elections details can be found on the
      <a href="../../">GNOME Foundation Web Site</a>.

      I am a long-time member of the GNOME community, and an employee of Red
      Hat, Inc.  I have been active on the Board for the past three years.  I
      also have previously been on the release team, and am currently on the
      sysadmin team. I am primarily interested in continuing to work with Tim
      and Jody to ensure that our finances remain in good shape.  We've had a
      better year financially, this past year, and I expect that we'll be able
      to continue this trend.  We have made great strides in our ability as a
      foundation to hold and fund conferences, and we should be able to do even
      more this year.  I'd also like to make our budgeting more transparent and
      public.

      I am an active and devoted member of GNOME and its usability team, I
      believe I've contributed to most core modules through ui-reviews and
      similar usability discussion. I believe the foundation has done and
      excellent job so far and I hope to see that continue while also becoming
      more transparent to the community at large. The foundation needs to
      continue to help GNOME reach out to new developers and expand its
      worldwide community of contributors.

      IMO Board issues for the next year will include leveraging grassroots
      GNOME support around the world, and facilitating use of the GNOME "brand"
      while defending GNOME and Free Software. Forging and strengthening
      relationships is important too. I work on GNOME software every

      of the GNOME Accessibility Project. "GNOME is for everybody!".

      If elected to the Gnome Foundation, I hope to make Gnome a more
      integrated and fulfilling experience to users and developers alike. We
      must attract new users and developers. This can be accomplished through
      encouraging technical consensus and continuing to foster a strong spirit
      of community. We must continue to organize and sponsor events such as
      GUADEC and the Gnome Summit and must coordinate efforts with grass-roots
      organizations, such as universities and LUGs.

    <blockquote>
      At last count, Gnome was suffering from a lack of clear, well
      articulated, technical leadership, with no mechanism for generating
      technical consensus (particularly where this requires compromise). This
      in general leads to directional atrophy, wasted effort, and violence
      towards domestic pets. The board shouldn't provide this leadership, but
      can encourage it. Furthermore it seems obvious that the Gnome environment
      should be further strengthened by compromise, alignment &amp;
      code-sharing with other projects eg. Mozilla &amp; OpenOffice.org.

      regional efforts: that it can be integrated into local GNU/Linux
      distributions easily, that it provides a good technology base for custom
      setups, that it is easy for developers to learn, and that it is

      Even though I'm probably an unknown to most of the GNOME developers, I
      have been around for quite a while, primarily in the GIMP project. Last
      year, I was involved in organising GUADEC, and also brought the GIMP
      under the GNOME Foundation umbrella, with help from Tim Ney and the
      current board. I'm more an organiser than a coder, and I actually like
      doing board-type activities. The board has a lot to offer to the
      community, especially in the realm of communication and organisation -
      being on the board doesn't mean running things, so much as letting other
      people know what needs running, and harnessing that enthusiasm.

      contributions to GNOME has been to organize and raise funds for GUADEC,
      the Summit and now other regional events in Brazil and Spain. For GNOME
      to scale to the widest geography of development, recognition and use, we
      need to assemble more resources to help provide training accessible to

      internationalization and keeping trust relationship at an individual
      level. I think those are needed to keep hacking on Gnome fun and getting
      acceptance in new communities. Growing GNOME presence worldwide in
      mindshare, users and developpers is the next challenge of the Board.
