    <h2>Elections Rules</h2> 

    <ol>
      <li>
        See the <a href="../../about/charter/">GNOME Foundation charter</a> for
        general rules.
      </li>
      <li>
        There are 11 board slots that are to be filled during these elections.
      </li>
      <li>
        Members of the GNOME Foundation as of November 6, 2004 are eligible to
        vote in the elections. Anyone who has made a contribution to GNOME can

        href="../../membership/application.php">application</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Any eligible voter is eligible to be elected to the Board of Directors.
        To announce your candidacy, send a message to
        <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-announce/">foundation-announce&#64;gnome&#46;org</a>
        with your full name, e-mail, corporate affiliation (if any), and a
        description of your reasons for wanting to serve as a director.
        Candidacies must be announced prior to November 8, 2004, 23:59 UTC.
      </li>
      <li>
        All candidates should mail a summary of their candicacy announcement
        (see previous rule) to <a
        href="mailto:elections&#64;gnome&#46;org">elections&#64;gnome&#46;org</a>.
        Summaries should be no more than 75 words of continuous text (i.e. no
        bullet lists or multiple paragraphs) and must be received by the
        nomination deadline given above.  A compilation of the summaries will
        be mailed to all registered voters several days prior to the elections.
      </li>
      <li>
        All discussion related to the elections should be held on
        <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/">foundation-list&#64;gnome&#46;org</a>.
        Members are invited to ask questions to one or all candidates on that
        list.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ballots will be sent via e-mail to all eligible voters on November 19,
        2004, and must be returned by December 6, 2004, 23:59 UTC (18:59 EST).
        Full instructions will be included in the ballot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ballots will be held confidential during the elections, but an archive
        of all submitted ballots will be made publicly accessible at its
        conclusion. <strong>The ballots will not be anonymized.</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        The Elections Committee is responsible for counting the ballots, after
        taking appropriate action to fix misformatted ballots. 
      </li>
      <li>
        The 11 candidates who receive the most votes will be elected, except
        that no more than four individuals affiliated with any one corporation
        may be elected. Should more than four of the top eleven vote-getters be
        affiliated with the same company, only the four with the most votes
        will be considered elected. For a full definition of corporate
        affiliation, see the <a href="../../about/charter/">GNOME Foundation charter</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the event of a tie for the final slot on the board, the Elections
        Committee will schedule run-off elections as soon as possible. 
      </li>
      <li>
        The Elections Committee will announce preliminary results as soon as
        possible after the elections close, along with instructions on how to
        access the ballot archive and how to independently verify the vote
        count.
      </li>
      <li>
        Any eligible voter may challenge the preliminary results by e-mailing
        <a
        href="mailto:elections&#64;gnome&#46;org">elections&#64;gnome&#46;org</a>
        prior to December 20, 2004. The decision of the Elections Committee as
        to any challenge shall be final. Once any challenges have been
        resolved, the Elections Committee shall announce the final results.
      </li>
      <li>
        Any questions regarding these procedures should be directed to the
        Elections Committee by e-mail to <a
        href="mailto:elections&#64;gnome&#46;org">elections&#64;gnome&#46;org</a>.
        The committee shall have the power to make any necessary changes or
        clarifications to these rules at any point during the elections.
