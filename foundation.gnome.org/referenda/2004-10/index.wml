    <h1>GNOME Foundation Anonymous Voting Referendum</h1>

    <p>
      Any member of the GNOME Foundation can suggest a referendum. To be
      accepted, a request for a referendum must be endorsed by 10% of the
      Membership. The overall referendum process is overseen by the
      Membership and Elections Committee, which can be reached at <a
      href="mailto:elections&#64;gnome&#46;org">elections&#64;gnome&#46;org</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In September 2003, the board discussed a possible move toward an anonymous
      voting scheme for the annual GNOME Foundation board of directors elections
      and brought it to the members on <a
      href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/">foundation-list&#64;gnome&#46;org</a>.
      After much discussion, it was agreed that there was significant objection to
      this so that the GNOME Foundation should hold a referendum to decide
      whether future elections should use an anonymous voting mechanism.
