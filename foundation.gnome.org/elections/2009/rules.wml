        href="mailto:elections&#64;gnome&#46;org">elections&#64;gnome&#46;org</a>.
        Summaries should be no more than 75 words of continuous text (i.e. no
        bullet lists or multiple paragraphs) and must be received by the
        nomination deadline given above. A compilation of the summaries will
        be mailed to all registered voters several days prior to the elections.

      <li>
        All discussion related to the elections should be held on
        <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/">foundation-list&#64;gnome&#46;org</a>.
        Members are invited to ask questions to one or all candidates on that
        list.
      </li>
      <li>
	Instructions explaining how to vote will be sent via e-mail to all
	eligible voters on June 3rd, 2009, and votes must be returned by

      </li>
      <li>
