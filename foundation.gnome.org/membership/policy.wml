  <h1>Membership Policy for the GNOME Foundation</h1>

  <h2>Who is eligible for membership in the GNOME Foundation?</h2>

  <p>
    Per the GNOME Foundation's charter, any contributor to GNOME is eligible
    for membership. Although it is difficult to specify a precise definition, a
    contributor generally must have contributed to a non-trivial improvement of
    the GNOME Project. Contributions may be code, documentation, translations,
    maintenance of project-wide resources, or other non-trivial activities which
    benefit the GNOME Project. While large amounts of advocacy or bug reporting
    may qualify one as a member, such contributions must be significantly above
   the level expected of an ordinary user. Membership eligibility is an
    individual determination: while contributions made in the course of
    employment will be considered, they will generally be ascribed to the
    individuals involved, rather than accruing to all employees of a
    "contributing" corporation. As noted above, these guidelines are not meant
    to define precise objective criteria: ultimately, an individual's membership
    eligibility will be determined on a case-by-case basis, in the sound
    discretion of the Membership Committee and the Board of Directors.
  </p>

  <p>
    For a more complete definition of the guidelines, you can look at the <a
    href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-announce/2002-October/msg00003.html">proposal
    for guidelines</a> that was accepted by the board in 2002 October.
  </p>


  <h2>How can I apply for membership in the GNOME Foundation?</h2>

  <p>
    To apply for membership, please complete the form available at <a
    href="http://foundation.gnome.org/membership/membership-form.php">
    http://foundation.gnome.org/membership-form.php</a>. Please note that
    applications for membership must include sufficient information to allow the
    Membership Committee to verify the applicants' eligibility; applications
    which include inaccurate or insufficient information may be rejected at the
    committee's discretion.
  </p>


  <h2>My application was rejected; what can I do?</h2>

  <p>
    If you have questions as to why your application was rejected, please
    contact the Membership Committee by electronic mail to <a
    href="mailto:membership-committee@gnome.org">membership-committee@gnome.org</a>;
    you may be able to provide additional information which will lead to the
    approval of your application. If you are still dissatisfied with the
    Membership Committee's determination, you may appeal the decision to the
    Board of Directors by e-mailing <a href="mailto:board@gnome.org">board@gnome.org</a>.
  </p>


  <h2>Renewing your membership</h2>

  <p>
    Membership in the GNOME Foundation ordinarily lasts for two years. A
    reasonable period of time before your membership expires, you will be
    contacted by the Membership Committee with a request that you file a renewal
    application, available <a href="membership-form.php">here</a>. Renewal
    applications will be reviewed according to the same standards outlined above
    for an initial membership, and must generally be supported by recent or
    ongoing contributions to GNOME. If you do not file a valid renewal
    application by the specified deadline, your membership will terminate;
    former members may, of course, file a new application for membership at a
    later date, again provided it is supported by recent or ongoing
    contributions.
