   <h1>The GNOME Foundation</h1>
   <h2>Introduction</h2>
   <p>
     The GNOME project has built a complete free and easy-to-use desktop
     environment for the user, as well as a powerful application
     framework for the software developer. GNOME is part of the
     <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU project</a>, and is free software
     (sometimes referred to as open source software.)
   </p>
   <p>
     The GNOME Foundation will work to further the goals of the GNOME project.
   </p>
   <p>
     To achieve these goals, the Foundation will coordinate releases of
     GNOME and determine which projects are part of GNOME. The Foundation
     will act as an official voice for the GNOME project, providing a means
     of communication with the press and with commercial and noncommercial
     organizations interested in GNOME software. The foundation may produce
     educational materials and documentation to help the public learn about
     GNOME software.  In addition, it may sponsor GNOME-related technical
     conferences, represent GNOME at relevant conferences sponsored by
     others, help create technical standards for the project and promote
     the use and development of GNOME software.
   </p>
