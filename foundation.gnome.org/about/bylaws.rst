.. comment:

        You can compile this document using Python's docutils like this:
        
                rst2latex --documentclass=scrartcl --documentoptions=a4paper,10pt,bigheading   --no-section-numbering bylaws-simple.rst > bylaws.tex
          
        Then you'll get a .tex file which you can compile using pdflatex. You probably need to have a couple of packages installed.
        If it complains about a missing .sty file, you can install it using yum:
        
                yum install -y 'tex(pdfcomment.sty)'



        The HTML version compiles similarly:
        
                rst2html --no-section-numbering --stylesheet=bylaws.css bylaws-simple.rst > bylaws.html

Name 
==================================================================

 
The name of the Corporation shall be GNOME Foundation (the "**Corporation**"), a California
Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation.




Offices 
==================================================================

 

Principal Office 
-----------------------------------------




The principal office for the transaction of business of the Corporation shall be determined
and may be changed from time to time by the Board of Directors (the "**Board**").


Other Offices 
-----------------------------------------

The Board may at any time establish branch or subordinate offices at any place or places
where the Corporation is qualified to do business.



Objectives 
==================================================================

 

The objectives of the Corporation shall be as stated in the Articles of Incorporation.
Specifically, the objectives shall include charitable and educational purposes within the meaning of
Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "**Internal Revenue
Code**"), or the corresponding provision of any future United States internal revenue law.



Nonpartisan Activities 
==================================================================

 

The Corporation has been formed under the California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation
Law (the "**CNPBCL**") for the purposes described above, and it shall be nonprofit and nonpartisan.
No substantial part of the activities of the Corporation shall consist of lobbying or propaganda, or
otherwise attempting to influence legislation, except as provided in Section 501(h) of the Internal
Revenue Code, and the Corporation shall not participate or intervene in (including publishing or
distributing statements) any political campaign on behalf of any candidate for public office except as
provided in Section 501(h) of the Internal Revenue Code.

The Corporation shall not, except in an insubstantial degree, engage in any activities or
exercise any powers that are not in furtherance of the purposes described above.



Dedication of Assets 
==================================================================

 

The properties and assets of the Corporation are irrevocably dedicated to charitable and
educational purposes meeting the requirements for exemption provided by Section 214 of the
California Revenue and Taxation Code. No part of the net income or assets of the Corporation, on
dissolution or otherwise, shall inure to the benefit of any private person or individual, or any member
or Director of the Corporation. On liquidation or dissolution of the Corporation, all properties and
assets and obligations shall be distributed and paid over to a nonprofit fund, foundation or
Corporation which is organized and operated exclusively for charitable and educational purposes
meeting the requirements for exemption provided by Section 214 of the California Revenue and
Taxation Code, and which has established its tax-exempt status under Section 501(c)(3) of the
Internal Revenue Code.




Membership 
==================================================================

 


Voting Members and Qualification 
-----------------------------------------

Initially, there shall be one class of voting members of the Corporation. Membership will
be determined on a case-by-case basis, at the sole discretion of the Board and Membership
Committee. Any contributor to GNOME shall be eligible for membership. A "contributor" shall be
defined as any individual who has contributed to a non-trivial improvement of the GNOME Project,
such as code, documentation, translations, maintenance of project-wide resources, or other
non-trivial activities which benefit the GNOME Project. Large amounts of advocacy or bug
reporting may qualify one as a contributor, provided that such contributions are significantly above
the level expected of an ordinary user. Contributions made in the course of employment will be
considered and will be ascribed to the individuals involved, rather than accruing to all employees of
a "contributing" corporation.


Other Classes of Membership 
-----------------------------------------

The Board may, from time to time, establish another class or classes of members, with or
without voting rights. The privileges, rights and duties of such other class or classes of members
shall be as provided by the Board, subject to the terms of the Bylaws, as amended from time to time.
The Board may thereby confer some or all of the rights of the members upon any person or persons.

If such person or persons do not have the right to vote for either:

1. the election of a Director or Directors, on a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of this corporation, on a merger, on a dissolution or

2. the selection of delegates who possess any such voting rights or

3. changes to the corporation's Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws,

such person shall not be a member within the meaning of Section 5056 of the Nonprofit Corporation Law of the State of California.




Honorary Nonmember Affiliates 
-----------------------------------------

The Directors may designate certain persons or groups of persons as sponsors, benefactors,
contributors, advisors or friends of the Corporation or such other title as they deem appropriate. Such
persons shall serve in an honorary capacity and, except as otherwise determined by the Board, shall
in such capacity have no right to notice of or to vote at any meeting, shall not be considered for
purposes of establishing a quorum, and shall have no other rights or responsibilities.

Term 
-----------------------------------------


The term of membership shall be two (2) years.


Admission and Removal 
-----------------------------------------

Admission or removal from membership shall be by the vote of a majority of the 
Directors then in office.


Fees, Dues and Assessments 
-----------------------------------------

The Board may determine from time to time an initial membership fee, and set such other
fees, dues and assessments for membership in the corporation as the Board, in its discretion, from
time to time determines.


Termination of Membership 
-----------------------------------------
 
The membership of any member shall terminate upon the occurrence of any one or more of
the following:

1.      **Resignation**. Any member may resign from the Corporation in writing filed with the
        Secretary of the Corporation. Such resignation shall become effective upon receipt thereof.

#.      **Expiration and Disqualification**. A membership issued for a period of time shall expire
        when such period of time has elapsed unless the membership is renewed. In the case of
        membership classifications for which qualification requirements are established, membership
        of a member shall terminate upon the determination of the Board or Membership Committee
        that the member no longer meets the qualification requirements for membership in the
        Corporation.

#.      **Removal or Suspension**. Membership shall terminate upon the determination of the Board
        or Membership Committee after a hearing duly held in accordance with this Section 6.7.3, that
        the member has failed in a material respect to observe the rules of conduct promulgated from
        time to time by the Board and applicable to members, or otherwise has failed in some
        material respect to merit continued membership privileges in the Corporation. In the event of
        a removal or suspension of a member, the following procedures shall be implemented:
        
        a)      A notice shall be sent by electronic mail and prepaid, first-class, certified or registered mail to the most recent
                address of the member, if known to the Corporation, setting forth the removal or
                suspension and the reason for that removal or suspension. Such notice shall be sent at least fifteen (15) days
                before the proposed effective date of the removal or suspension.
    
        #)      The member being expelled or suspended shall be given an opportunity to be heard, either
                orally or in writing, at a hearing to be held no fewer than five (5) days before the removal.
                The hearing shall be held by the Board or Membership Committee. Any such hearing may
                be held by conference telephone or similar communications equipment, so long as all
                participants in the hearing can hear one another. The notice to the member of their
                proposed removal or suspension shall state that such member is entitled, upon request, to
                such hearing, shall state that a date, time and place of hearing will be established upon receipt
                of such a request, and shall state, that in the absence of such request, the effective date of
                the proposed suspension or removal.
            
        #)      Following the hearing, the Board, or Membership committee, as the case may be, shall
                decide whether the member should in fact be expelled, suspended, or sanctioned in some
                other way. The decision of the Board or Membership Committee, as the case may be, shall
                be final, subject to any challenge brought pursuant to this section.
            
        #)      A member may bring an action challenging a removal or suspension of membership, including any claim
                alleging defective notice, within one year after the date of the removal
                or suspension.




Reinstatement 
-----------------------------------------

Suspended or expelled members may be reinstated at the discretion of the Board.

Property Rights 
-----------------------------------------

No member shall have any right or interest in any of the property or assets of this
Corporation.

Corporation.

No member may transfer for value or otherwise a membership or any right arising
therefrom, and all rights of membership shall cease upon the member's death or dissolution of this
Corporation.

A notice of each annual meeting, and special meeting shall be given by the President or, in case of their failure or refusal, by
any other officer or any Director; shall specify the place, time, day and hour of the meeting or the
date on which the ballot shall be returned, if applicable; and in the case of special meetings, the nature of the
business to be transacted thereat. Such notice shall be given in writing to every member of the
Corporation who, on the record date for notice of the meeting, is entitled to vote thereat. Such notice
shall be given either personally or by sending a copy thereof by first-class mail or by telephone
communication, including a voice messaging system or other system or technology designed to
record and communicate messages, telegraph, facsimile, electronic mail, or other electronic means,

expected to communicate such notice promptly to the member at least thirty (30) days prior to the

all other meetings.

Any members' meeting, annual or special, whether or not a quorum is present, may be
adjourned from time to time by the vote of a majority of the members, but in the absence of a
quorum no other business may be transacted at any such meeting. No meeting may be adjourned for
more than forty-five (45) days. It shall not be necessary to give any such notice of the time and
place of the adjourned meeting or of the business to be transacted thereat, other than by an

votes.


Action Without Meeting by Written Ballot 
-----------------------------------------

Any action which may be taken at any regular or special meeting of members may be taken
without a meeting if the Corporation distributes a written ballot to every member entitled to vote on
the matter. Such ballot shall set forth the proposed action, provide an opportunity to specify
approval or disapproval of any proposal, and provide a reasonable time within which to return the
ballot to the corporation. Approval by written ballot shall be valid only when the number of votes
cast by ballot within the time period specified equals or exceeds a quorum of the members, and the
number of approvals equals or exceeds the number of votes that would be required to approve at a
meeting at which the total number of votes cast was the same as the number of votes cast by ballot.

-----------------------------------------

Any member of the Corporation may propose a referendum. Such request for a referendum must be endorsed by 10\% of the Membership. The overall referendum process shall be conducted by the Membership and Elections Committee, as authorized by the Directors pursuant to Article IX.

The Board may fix, in advance, a record date for the purpose of determining the members
entitled to notice of and to vote at any meeting of members, give consent to corporate action in
writing without a meeting, receive any report, receive any allotment of rights, or exercise rights in
respect to any change in membership rights or liabilities. Only members of record on the record date
are entitled to notice of and to vote at any such meeting, give consent without a meeting, receive any
reports, receive allotment of rights, or exercise the rights, as the case may be, notwithstanding any
transfer of memberships on the books of the corporation after the record date, except as otherwise
provided in the Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws. The Board shall fix, in advance, record

1.      **Notice**. The record date for determination of the members entitled to notice of any meeting
        of members shall not be more than ninety (90) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of
        the meeting. If no record date is fixed, members at the close of business on the business day
        preceding the day on which notice is given or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on
        the business day preceding the day on which the meeting is held are entitled to notice of a
        meeting of members shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting unless the Board fixes a
        new record date for the adjourned meeting.

2.      **Vote**. The record date for the purpose of determining the members entitled to vote at a
        meeting of members shall not be more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting.
        Such record date shall also apply in the case of an adjournment of the meeting unless the
        Board fixes a new record date for the adjourned meeting. If no record date is fixed, members
        on the day of the meeting who are otherwise eligible to vote are entitled to vote at the
        meeting of members or, in the case of an adjourned meeting, members on the day of the

        meeting of members.

3.      **Written Ballots**. The record date for the purpose of determining members entitled to cast
        written ballots shall not be more than sixty (60) days before the day on which the first written
        ballot is mailed or solicited. If no record date is fixed, members on the day of the first
        written ballot is mailed or solicited who are otherwise eligible to vote are entitled to cast
        written ballots.




Conduct of Meetings 
-----------------------------------------

Meetings of members shall be presided over by the President of the Corporation, or in their 
absence, by the Chair of the Corporation, or in their absence, by a Chair chosen
by a majority of the members present. The Secretary of the Corporation shall act as the secretary of
all meetings of members, provided that in their absence the presiding officer shall appoint
another member to act as Acting Secretary of the meeting.








Directors 
==================================================================

 

Powers 
-----------------------------------------

1.      **General corporate powers**. Subject to the provisions of the CNPBCL and any other
        applicable laws, the business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed, and all
        corporate powers shall be exercised, by or under the direction of the Board.

2.      **Specific powers**. Without prejudice to these general powers, and subject to the same
        limitations, the Board shall have power to:
        
        a)      Select and remove all officers, agents and employees of the Corporation; prescribe any powers and duties for them that are consistent with law, with the Articles of Incorporation and with these bylaws; and fix their compensation.

        #)      Change the principal executive office or the principal business office from one location to
                another; cause the Corporation to be qualified to do business in any other state, territory,
                dependency or country and conduct business within or outside the State of California; and
                designate any place within or outside the State of California for the holding of any members'
                meeting or meetings, including annual meetings.

        #)      Adopt, make and use a corporate seal and alter the form of the seal.

        #)      Borrow money and incur indebtedness on behalf of the Corporation and cause to be
                executed and delivered for the Corporation's purposes, in the corporate name, promissory
                notes, bonds, debentures, deeds of trust, mortgages, pledges, hypothecations and other
                evidences of debt and securities.



Number and Qualification of Directors 
-----------------------------------------

1.      The Directors shall fix their number at an annual meeting. At any special or regular
        meeting, the Directors then in office may increase the number of Directors and elect new
        Directors to complete the number so fixed; or they may decrease the number of Directors, but
        only to eliminate vacancies existing by reason of the death, resignation, removal or
        disqualification of one or more Directors.

2.      A Director shall be a Member.

3.      The number of Directors on October 31, 2012 is seven (7).

4.      No organization, corporation or similar entity, or any affiliate thereof, shall hold, directly or
        indirectly, more than 40\% of the Board seats, regardless of election results. In the event that
        any election of directors results in a single entity representing greater than 40\% of the Board,
        than the nominee representing that entity receiving the least number of votes, shall be
        replaced by the nominee receiving the greatest number of votes who was not elected to the
        Board. In the event that the resignation or removal of a director results in a single entity
        representing greater than 40\% of the Board, the Board shall as soon as practicable, appoint a
        new director not representing that entity to serve until the next election of directors. For the
        purposes of this section, "affiliate" shall mean representatives who are employees, officers,
        or members of the Board of Directors of an entity; who have a significant consulting
        relationship with an entity; or who own at least 1\% of the equity or debt, or derivatives
        thereof, of an entity.



Election and Term of Office of Directors 
-----------------------------------------

1.      For the purpose of staggering the Directors’ terms of office with one-half (1/2) of
        the Board of Directors eligible for election or replacement every two (2) years,
        the Board of Directors shall divide the Directors serving at the time of the
        adoption of these bylaws, and any additional Directors appointed at such time,
        into two (2) classes as nearly equal in number as possible, as follows:

        a)     For the initial terms after the adoption of these Amended and Restated
               Bylaws, each such class shall be appointed to a term of one (1) or two (2) years
        #)     At the conclusion of such initial terms set forth in Section
               8.3.1(a) of these bylaws, each Director’s subsequent term (and for each
               subsequent term thereafter) shall be for a period of two (2) years and
               until the election and qualification of a successor, or until such
               Director’s death, resignation, or removal.
        #)     In the event of an increase or decrease in the number of
               Directors, additional Directors may be elected to terms of one (1) or
               two (2) years as may be necessary to maintain equality in numbers among
               classes of Directors.


2.      Directors shall be elected by the membership in accordance with the rules set forth on
        http://foundation.gnome.org/electionrules.html.

3.      Each Director shall serve until their successor is duly elected and qualified or until their earlier
        death, resignation or removal. No reduction of the authorized number of Directors shall have
        the effect of removing any Director before that Director's term of office expires.



Vacancy 
-----------------------------------------

1.      **Events causing vacancy**. A vacancy or vacancies in the Board shall be deemed to exist on
        the occurrence of the following:
        
        a)      The death, resignation or removal of any Director.
        #)      The declaration by resolution of the Board of a vacancy of the office of a Director who
                has been declared of unsound mind by an order of court or convicted of a felony or has been
                found by final order or judgment of any court to have breached a duty under Article 3 of
                Chapter 2 of the CNPBCL.
        #)      The increase of the authorized number of Directors.


2.      **Resignations**. Except as provided in this paragraph, any Director may resign, which
        resignation shall be effective on giving written notice to the Chair of the Board, the
        president, the secretary or the Board of Directors, unless the notice specifies a later time for
        the resignation to become effective. If the resignation of a Director is effective at a future
        time, the Board of Directors may elect a successor to take office when the resignation
        becomes effective. No Director may resign when the Corporation would then be left without
        a duly elected Director or Directors in charge of its affairs.


3.      **Removals**. A Director may be removed for cause. In the event such removal, the following
        procedures shall be implemented:

        a)      A notice shall be sent by electronic mail and by prepaid, first-class, certified or registered mail to the
                most recent address of the member, if known by the Corporation, setting forth the
                removal and the reason for that removal. Such notice shall be sent at least seven (7) days before the
                proposed effective date of the removal.

        #)      The Director being removed shall be given an opportunity to be heard, either orally or in
                writing, at a hearing to be held no fewer than five (5) days before the removal. The hearing
                shall be held by the Board. The notice to the Director of their proposed removal shall
                state that such member is entitled, upon request, to such hearing, shall state that a date, time
                and place of hearing will be established upon receipt of such a request, and shall state, that
                in the absence of such request, the effective date of the proposed removal.

        #)      Following the hearing, the Board shall decide whether the Director should in fact be
                expelled, suspended, or sanctioned in some other way. The decision of the Board shall be
                final.


4.      **Filling vacancies**. Vacancies on the Board may be filled by a majority of the Directors then
        in office, whether or not less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining Director.
        Each director so elected shall serve until end of the term of the class
        of Directors to which the Director has been so elected and until such
        Director’s successor is elected and qualified.

5.      **No vacancy on reduction of number of Directors**. No reduction of the authorized number
        of Directors shall have the effect of removing any Director before that Director's term of
        office expires.

6.      **Restriction on interested Directors**. Not more than forty-nine percent (49\%) of the persons
        serving on the Board at any time may be interested persons.
        An interested person is
        
        a)      any person being compensated by the Corporation for services rendered to it in the previous twelve (12) months, whether as a full-time or part-time employee, independent contractor or otherwise, excluding any reasonable compensation paid to a Director as Director; and

the purpose of organization, election of officers and the transaction of other business.

                   either directly to
                   the Director or to a person at the Director's office who would reasonably be expected to
                   communicate such notice promptly to the Director. All such notices shall be given or sent to
                   the Director's address or telephone number as shown on the records of the Corporation.

        #)      **Time requirements**. Notices sent by first-class mail shall be deposited into a United States

        #)      **Notice contents**. The notice shall state the time and place for the meeting. However, it
                need not specify the purpose of the meeting, or the place of the meeting if it is to be held at
                the principal executive office of the Corporation.



Quorum 
-----------------------------------------


A majority of the authorized number of Directors shall constitute a quorum for the
transaction of business, except to adjourn as provided in Section 8.11 of this Article VIII.
Every action taken or decision made by a majority of the Directors present at a meeting duly held at which
a quorum is present shall be regarded as the act of the Board, subject to the provisions of the
CNPBCL, especially those provisions relating to:

1.      approval of contracts or transactions in which a
        Director has a direct or indirect material financial interest,

2.      creation of and appointment to
        committees of the Board and

3.      indemnification of Directors.

.. _Section Adjournment: `Adjournment`_
.. _Article Directors: `Directors`_


Waiver of Notice 
-----------------------------------------

The transactions of any meeting of the Board of Directors, however called and noticed or
wherever held, shall be as valid as though taken at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice if

1.      a quorum is present and

2.      either before or after the meeting, each of the Directors not present
        signs a written waiver of notice, a consent to holding the meeting or an approval of the minutes.


The
waiver of notice or consent need not specify the purpose of the meeting. All waivers, consents and
approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting.
Notice of a meeting shall also be deemed given to any Director who attends the meeting
without protesting before or at its commencement about the lack of adequate notice.



Adjournment 
-----------------------------------------
 
A majority of the Directors present, whether or not constituting a quorum, may adjourn any
meeting to another time and place.



Notice of Adjournment 
-----------------------------------------

Notice of the time and place of holding an adjourned meeting need not be given, unless the
meeting is adjourned for more than twenty-four (24) hours, in which case personal notice of the time
and place shall be given before the time of the adjourned meeting to the Directors who were not
present at the time of adjournment.



Action Without Meeting 
-----------------------------------------

Any action required or permitted to be taken by the Board may be taken without a meeting if
**all** members of the Board, individually or collectively, consent in writing to the action; provided,
however, that the consent of any Director who has a material financial interest in a transaction to
which the Corporation is a party and who is an "interested Director" as defined in Section 5233 of
the California Corporations Code shall not be required for approval of that transaction. Such action
by written consent shall have the same force and effect as a unanimous vote of the Board. Such
written consent or consents shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the Board.



Fees and Compensation 
-----------------------------------------

Directors as such shall not receive any compensation for their services, but by resolution of
the Board, expenses of attendance, if any, may be allowed for attendance at regular or special
meetings of the Board; but nothing herein contained shall be construed to preclude any Director
from serving the Corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation for this.





Committees 
==================================================================

 

Committees of the Board 
-----------------------------------------

The Board, by resolution adopted by a majority of the Directors then in office, provided a
quorum is present, may create or remove one or more committees, to serve at the pleasure of the Board.
Appointments to committees of the Board shall be by majority vote of the Directors then in office.
The Board may appoint one or more alternate members of any such committee, who may replace
any absent member at any meeting of the committee.


Meetings and Action of Committees 
-----------------------------------------

Meetings and actions of committees of the Board shall be governed by, held and taken in
accordance with the provisions of these bylaws concerning meetings and other Board actions, except
that the time for regular meetings of such committees and the calling of special meetings of such
committees may be determined either by Board resolution or, if there is none, by resolution of the
committee of the Board. Minutes of each meeting of any committee of the Board shall be kept and
shall be filed with the corporate records. The Board may adopt rules for the government of any
committee, provided they are consistent with these bylaws, or in the absence of rules adopted by the
Board, the committee may adopt such rules.


Term of Office 
-----------------------------------------

Each member of a committee shall continue as such until the next annual meeting of the
Board of the Corporation and until their successor is appointed, unless the committee shall be sooner
terminated, or unless such member be removed from such committee, or unless such member shall
cease to qualify as a member thereof.


Vacancies 
-----------------------------------------

Vacancies in the membership of any committee may be filled by appointments made in the
manner as provided in the case of the original appointments.


Quorum 
-----------------------------------------

Unless otherwise provided in the resolution of the Board designating a committee, a majority
of the whole committee shall constitute a quorum and the act of a majority of the members present at
a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the committee.


Rules 
-----------------------------------------

Each committee may adopt rules for its own government not inconsistent with these bylaws
or with rules adopted by the Board.


Limitations 
-----------------------------------------

No committee may:

1.      fill any vacancies on the Board or on any committee;

        a)      to which the Corporation is a party and one or more Directors
                have a material financial interest; or
        #)      between the Corporation and one or more of its
                Directors or between the Corporation or any person in which one or more of its Directors
                have a material financial interest.




.. The following incoming anchor needs to be defined because reST doesn't like the section and the subsection being named Officers

.. _sec\:officers:

Officers 
==================================================================

 

Officers 
-----------------------------------------

The officers of the Corporation shall be a Chair of the Board (if appointed by the Board),
a President, one or more Vice Presidents (the number thereof to be determined by the Board), a
Secretary, a Treasurer and such other officers as may be elected in accordance with the provisions of

-----------------------------------------


The officers of the Corporation, except such officers as may be appointed in accordance
with the provisions of Section 10.3 or Section 10.5 of this Article X, shall be chosen

disqualified to serve, or their successor shall be elected and qualified, subject to the rights, if
any, of an officer under any contract of employment. New offices may be created and filled at any
meeting of the Board. Each officer shall hold office until that officer's successor shall have been
duly elected and shall have qualified.

.. _Section Subordinate Officers: `Subordinate Officers`_
.. _Section Vacancies: `sec\:vacancies`_
.. _Article Officers: `sec\:officers`_


Subordinate Officers 
-----------------------------------------
 
The Board may appoint such other officers, including one or more assistant secretaries and
one or more assistant treasurers, as it shall deem desirable, each such officer to have the authority
and perform the duties prescribed from time to time by the Board and to hold office until they
shall resign or shall be removed or otherwise disqualified to serve.


Removal and Resignation 
-----------------------------------------

1.      **Removal**. Any officer, other than the President, may be removed with or without cause. In
        the event such removal, the following procedures shall be implemented:
        
        a)      A notice shall be sent by electronic mail and by prepaid, first-class, certified or registered mail to the
                most recent address of the officer if known by the Corporation, setting forth the
                removal and the reason for that removal. Such notice shall be sent at least seven (7) days before the
                proposed effective date of the removal.
                
        #)      The officer being removed shall be given an opportunity to be heard, either orally or in
                writing, at a hearing to be held no fewer than five (5) days before the removal. The hearing
                shall be held by the Board. The notice to the Officer of their proposed removal shall
                state that such member is entitled, upon request, to such hearing, shall state that a date, time
                and place of hearing will be established upon receipt of such a request, and shall state, that
                in the absence of such request, the effective date of the proposed removal.

        #)     Following the hearing, the Board shall decide whether the Officer should in fact be
               expelled, suspended, or sanctioned in some other way. The decision of the Board shall be
               final.

2.      **Resignation**. Any officer may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Board or to
        the president or to the secretary of the Corporation. Any such resignation shall take effect at
        the date of the receipt of such notice or at any later time specified therein; and, unless
        otherwise specified therein, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make
        it effective. Any resignation shall be without prejudice to the rights, if any, of the
        Corporation under any contract to which the officer is a party.

.. Again, this reference needs to be explicitely given because there is another "Vacancies" section.

Indemnification of Directors, Officers, Employees and Other Agents 
==================================================================

 

Definitions 
-----------------------------------------


For the purpose of this Article XI:

1.      "agent" means any person who is or was a Director, officer, employee, committee member
	or other agent of the Corporation; or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
	Director, officer, employee or other agent of another foreign or domestic Corporation,
	partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise; or was a Director, officer, employee or
	other agent of a foreign or domestic Corporation that was a predecessor Corporation of the
	Corporation or of another enterprise at the request of the predecessor Corporation.


2.	"proceeding" means any threatened, pending or completed action or proceeding, whether
	civil, criminal, administrative or investigative; and

3. 	"expenses" includes, without limitation, all attorneys' fees, costs and any other expenses
	incurred in the defense of any claims or proceedings against an agent by reason of their
	position or relationship as agent and all attorneys' fees, costs and other expenses incurred in
	establishing a right to indemnification under this Article XI.



Successful Defense by Agent 
-----------------------------------------
 
To the extent that an agent of the Corporation has been successful on the merits in the
defense of any proceeding referred to in this Article XI,
or in the defense of any claim, issue or
matter therein, the agent shall be indemnified against expenses actually and reasonably incurred by
the agent in connection with the claim. If an agent either settles any such claim or sustains a
judgment rendered against them, then the provisions of Sections 3 through 5 below shall
determine whether the agent is entitled to indemnification.



Actions Brought by Persons Other than the Corporation 
---------------------------------------------------------

Subject to the required findings to be made pursuant to Section 11.5 below, the Corporation
shall indemnify any person who was or is a party, or is threatened to be made a party, to any
proceeding, other than an action brought by, or on behalf of, the Corporation, or by an officer,
Director or person granted related status by the Attorney General, or by the Attorney General on the
ground that the defendant Director was or is engaging in self-dealing within the meaning of
California Corporations Code Section 5233, or by the Attorney General or a person granted related
status by the Attorney General for any breach of duty relating to assets held in charitable trust, by
reason of the fact that such person is or was an agent of the Corporation, for all expenses, judgments,
fines, settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with the
proceeding.



Actions Brought by or on Behalf of the Corporation 
---------------------------------------------------------
 
1.      **Claims settled out of court**. If any agent settles or otherwise disposes of a threatened or
pending action brought by or on behalf of the Corporation, with or without court approval,
the agent shall receive no indemnification for either amounts paid pursuant to the terms of
the settlement or other disposition or for any expenses incurred in defending against the
proceeding.

2.      **Claims and suits awarded against agent**. The Corporation shall indemnify any person who
        was or is a party, or is threatened to be made a party, to any threatened, pending or completed
        action brought by or on behalf of the Corporation, by reason of the fact that the person is or
        was an agent of the Corporation, for all expenses actually and reasonably incurred in
        connection with the defense of that action, provided that both of the following are met:
        
        a)      The determination of good faith conduct required by Section 11.5 below must be made in the
                manner provided for in that section; and

        #)      Upon application, the court in which the action was brought must determine that, in view
                of all of the circumstances of the case, the agent should be entitled to indemnity for the
                expenses incurred.

        If the agent is found to be so entitled, the court shall determine the
        appropriate amount of expenses to be reimbursed.


Determination of Agent's Good Faith Conduct 
---------------------------------------------


The indemnification granted to an agent in Sections 11.3 and 11.4 above is conditioned on the
following:

1.      **Required standard of conduct**. The agent seeking reimbursement must be found, in the
        manner provided below, to have acted in good faith, in a manner they believed to be in
        the best interest of the Corporation, and with such care, including reasonable inquiry, as an
        ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use in similar circumstances. The
        termination of any proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or on a plea of
        *nolo contendere* or its equivalent, shall not, in itself, create a presumption that the person did
        not act in good faith or in a manner which they reasonably believed to be in the best
        interest of the Corporation or that they had reasonable cause to believe that their
        conduct was unlawful. In the case of a criminal proceeding, the person must have had no
        reasonable cause to believe that their conduct was unlawful.

2.      **Manner of determination of good faith conduct**. The determination that the agent did act in
        a manner complying with paragraph a above shall be made by:
        
        a)      the Board, by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Directors who are not parties to
                the proceeding; or

        b)      the court in which the proceeding is or was pending.



        Such determination may be made on
        application brought by the Corporation or the agent or the attorney or other person rendering
        a defense to the agent, whether or not the application by the agent, attorney or other person is
        opposed by the Corporation.



Limitations 
-----------------------------------------


No indemnification or advance shall be made under this Article XI,
except as provided in Section 11.2 or 11.5.2 above, in any circumstance when it appears:

1.      That the indemnification or advance would be inconsistent with a provision of the Articles
        of Incorporation, a resolution of the Board or an agreement in effect at the time of the accrual
        of the alleged cause of action asserted in the proceeding in connection with which the
        expenses were incurred, or other amounts were paid, which prohibits or otherwise limits
        indemnification; or

2.      That the indemnification would be inconsistent with any condition expressly provided by a
        court in approving a settlement.



Advance of Expenses 
-----------------------------------------

Expenses incurred in defending any proceeding may be advanced by the Corporation before
the final disposition of the proceeding, on receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the agent to
repay the amount of the advance unless it is determined ultimately that the agent is entitled to be
indemnified as authorized in this Article XI.



Contractual Rights of Non-Directors and Non-Officers 
-------------------------------------------------------


Nothing contained in this Article XI shall affect any right to indemnification to which
persons other than Directors and officers of the Corporation, or any subsidiary hereof, may be
entitled by contract or otherwise.


Insurance 
-----------------------------------------

The Board may adopt a resolution authorizing the purchase and maintenance of insurance on
behalf of any agent of the Corporation against any liability asserted against or incurred by the agent
in such capacity or arising out of the agent's status as such, whether or not the Corporation would
have the power to indemnify the agent against that liability under the provisions of this Article XI;
provided, however, that the Corporation shall not have the power to purchase and maintain such
insurance to indemnify any agent of the Corporation for a violation of Section 5233 of the California
Corporations Code.


Fiduciaries of Corporate Employee Benefit Plan 
-------------------------------------------------

This Article XI
does not apply to any proceeding against any trustee, investment manager or
other fiduciary of an employee benefit plan in that person's capacity as such, even though that person
may also be an agent of the Corporation as defined in Section 11.1.1 of this Article XI. Nothing
contained in this Article XI shall limit any right to indemnification to which such a trustee,
investment manager or other fiduciary may be entitled by contract or otherwise, which shall be
enforceable to the extent permitted by applicable law.

==================================================================



Maintenance and Inspection of Articles and Bylaws

liable for any purpose or in any amount.

All checks, drafts or other orders for payment of money, notes or other evidences of

day of September in each year.





Construction and Definition
