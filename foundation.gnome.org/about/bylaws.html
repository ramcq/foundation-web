<!-- comment:

You can compile this document using Python's docutils like this:

        rst2latex - -documentclass=scrartcl - -documentoptions=a4paper,10pt,bigheading   - -no-section-numbering bylaws-simple.rst > bylaws.tex

Then you'll get a .tex file which you can compile using pdflatex. You probably need to have a couple of packages installed.
If it complains about a missing .sty file, you can install it using yum:

        yum install -y 'tex(pdfcomment.sty)'



The HTML version compiles similarly:

        rst2html - -no-section-numbering - -stylesheet=bylaws.css bylaws-simple.rst > bylaws.html -->
<!-- To turn off the comment function, uncomment (remove the first two leading dots and the white space) the following -->
<!-- :raw-latex:`\renewcommand{\DUrolecomment}[1]{}` -->

<div class="section" id="objectives">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">Objectives</a></h1>
<p>The objectives of the Corporation shall be as stated in the Articles of Incorporation.
Specifically, the objectives shall include charitable and educational purposes within the meaning of

Code</strong>&quot;), or the corresponding provision of any future United States internal revenue law.</p>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">Nonpartisan Activities</a></h1>
<p>The Corporation has been formed under the California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation
Law (the &quot;<strong>CNPBCL</strong>&quot;) for the purposes described above, and it shall be nonprofit and nonpartisan.
No substantial part of the activities of the Corporation shall consist of lobbying or propaganda, or
otherwise attempting to influence legislation, except as provided in Section 501(h) of the Internal
Revenue Code, and the Corporation shall not participate or intervene in (including publishing or
distributing statements) any political campaign on behalf of any candidate for public office except as

defined as any individual who has contributed to a non-trivial improvement of the GNOME Project,
such as code, documentation, translations, maintenance of project-wide resources, or other
non-trivial activities which benefit the GNOME Project. Large amounts of advocacy or bug
reporting may qualify one as a contributor, provided that such contributions are significantly above
the level expected of an ordinary user. Contributions made in the course of employment will be
considered and will be ascribed to the individuals involved, rather than accruing to all employees of
a &quot;contributing&quot; corporation.</p>
</div>

without voting rights. The privileges, rights and duties of such other class or classes of members
shall be as provided by the Board, subject to the terms of the Bylaws, as amended from time to time.
The Board may thereby confer some or all of the rights of the members upon any person or persons.</p>

<li>the election of a Director or Directors, on a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of this corporation, on a merger, on a dissolution or</li>

<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>Resignation</strong>. Any member may resign from the Corporation in writing filed with the
Secretary of the Corporation. Such resignation shall become effective upon receipt thereof.</li>
<li><strong>Expiration and Disqualification</strong>. A membership issued for a period of time shall expire
when such period of time has elapsed unless the membership is renewed. In the case of
membership classifications for which qualification requirements are established, membership
of a member shall terminate upon the determination of the Board or Membership Committee
that the member no longer meets the qualification requirements for membership in the
Corporation.</li>
<li><strong>Removal or Suspension</strong>. Membership shall terminate upon the determination of the Board
or Membership Committee after a hearing duly held in accordance with this Section 6.7.3, that
the member has failed in a material respect to observe the rules of conduct promulgated from
time to time by the Board and applicable to members, or otherwise has failed in some
material respect to merit continued membership privileges in the Corporation. In the event of
a removal or suspension of a member, the following procedures shall be implemented:<ol class="loweralpha">
<li>A notice shall be sent by electronic mail and prepaid, first-class, certified or registered mail to the most recent
address of the member, if known to the Corporation, setting forth the removal or
suspension and the reason for that removal or suspension. Such notice shall be sent at least fifteen (15) days
before the proposed effective date of the removal or suspension.</li>
<li>The member being expelled or suspended shall be given an opportunity to be heard, either
orally or in writing, at a hearing to be held no fewer than five (5) days before the removal.
The hearing shall be held by the Board or Membership Committee. Any such hearing may
be held by conference telephone or similar communications equipment, so long as all
participants in the hearing can hear one another. The notice to the member of his or her
proposed removal or suspension shall state that such member is entitled, upon request, to
such hearing, shall state that a date, time and place of hearing will be established upon receipt
of such a request, and shall state, that in the absence of such request, the effective date of
the proposed suspension or removal.</li>
<li>Following the hearing, the Board, or Membership committee, as the case may be, shall
decide whether the member should in fact be expelled, suspended, or sanctioned in some
other way. The decision of the Board or Membership Committee, as the case may be, shall
be final, subject to any challenge brought pursuant to this section.</li>
<li>A member may bring an action challenging a removal or suspension of membership, including any claim
alleging defective notice, within one year after the date of the removal
or suspension.</li>
