</P>
<P>Below you will find a list of candidates who are running for the
GNOME Foundation Board of Directors. A short summary statement from
each candidate and a link to their full candidacy announcement is
provided to help you learn more about them. We encourage all voters
to read the full candidacy statements and related discussions on
foundation-list@gnome.org
(<A HREF="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/">http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/</A>).</P>
<P>When deciding who you should vote for, please carefully consider
the various tasks the Board of Directors must perform. This overview
(<A HREF="/overview.html">http://foundation.gnome.org/overview.html</A>)

important decisions and will also have to perform many tasks which
require a significant amount of time and effort and the ability to
work and communicate with other people, companies, and the media. The
board of directors will represent GNOME to companies and the world in
a very real way. It is a good idea to strive for a well-balanced
board consisting of people with various backgrounds, skills, and
perspectives.</P>

<P><B>CANDIDATES FOR THE GNOME FOUNDATION BOARD OF DIRECTORS</B> 
</P>
<P>1. MARTIN BAULIG. &quot;I'm a 24 years old student and working for
SuSE on GNOME. * Gnome-libs 2.0 - it is very important to be
attractive to developers of other Free Software, to have
well-designed, well-documented APIs which are a pleasure to use. *
GNOME is official part of the GNU Project and it becomes more and
more important to know where we're coming from and to stick to our
roots. * Doing Talks and Shows in Germany.&quot; Affiliated with
SuSE. Full statement at

<P>2. CHEMA CELORIO. &quot;I have been doing unpaid work for GNOME on
a daily basis for the last year. Mainly in gedit and gnome-print. And
I LOVE IT ! I have developed very good personal relationships with
different members of the GNOME community. I want GNOME to remain a
community effort, a fun project to work on and a project that has
healthy relationships with the companies it interacts with. I want
GNOME to continue being widely open to new contributors.&quot; Full

<P>3. KENNETH CHRISTIANSEN. &quot;I will work on making Gnome work
better with internationalization, so that people in non-english
speaking countries can start using Gnome for real. This requires a
lot of work, and everyone in the Gnome community will have to settle
on some common guidelines for dealing with this. Due to my long
involvement in Gnome Translation Project I have quite some idea of
how we can do this, and is personally interested in working hard for
archieving this. No corporate affiliations!&quot; Full statement at

<P>4. RHETT CREIGHTON. &quot;I am a Jr. undergrad student at MIT, and
I'd like to see Gnome succeed, like all of you. If I win, I don't
promise to do a better job than most of you could do, but I do
promise to do it while eating a truckload of bananas. Really, I want
to use the position to impress chicks, I mean, help guide the
direction of Gnome toward what I think will make it the ideal
computing platform.&quot;. Full statement at

<P>5. BART DECREM. &quot;As the Foundation's coordinator, I have
helped build a structure that maintains the power in GNOME with the
hackers while providing ways for corporate partners to have their
voice heard. I see my role as a facilitator who ensures that the
foundation will function in an open and effective manner, and to help
bring corporate partners on board who will bring GNOME to many
millions of new users without violating our principles.&quot;

<P>8. JUANTOMAS GARCIA. Spent last three years promoting GNU/Linux
and free software in Spain, to companies and the Spanish government,
among others: &quot;GNOME needs more than code, it needs lots of
input and work on and over it... The board needs to have a real
criticism from the inside that's brave enough to point out whatever
is wrong with GNOME... I'm Spanish and European (and very proud of
it) and Europe needs more GNOME action indeed.&quot; Full statement

built; currently pushing Linux and X on handhelds. Experience with X
Consortium, W3C, IETF. Worked on the GNOME Foundation announcement

<P>17. ELLIOT LEE. &quot;You, the people who have made GNOME happen,
deserve the best possible help in getting GNOME where you want it to

need doing, so that you can focus on having fun contributing.&quot;

between maintainers. I want to see GNOME get bigger, better, and more
fun, always remaining focused on technical excellence.&quot;

project, and am in the process of forming a GNOME HI group that will
raise community and developer awareness of usability and visual
issues with GNOME projects. I'd like to have a seat on the board so I

<P>30. JOE SHAW. &quot;I have been involved in the GNOME community
from the start, contributing to several modules. I'm the maintainer
of Achtung and author of Helix's installer and updater. I'm outspoken
against corporate dominance of the foundation, but know they need to
be well-represented. I feel that the board needs a good
hacker/non-hacker mix. GNOME needs to become more aggressive with its
conference/show policies and GNOME 2.0 development needs to take hold
now.&quot; Affiliated with Helix Code. Full statement at

software projects (most notably Nautilus, see
<A HREF="http://advogato.org/person/mjs">http://advogato.org/person/mjs</A>
for others), I think the strongest qualifications I have are
non-technical. First, I have a talent for making processes more
transparent, as with my work on GNOME 1.4 coordiation. Second, I am
good at communicating both inside and outside the project. Finally, I
believe in free software, openness and honesty, and I'm willing to
stand up to anyone for these beliefs.&quot; Affiliated with Eazel.

<P>32. OWEN TAYLOR. &quot;As co-maintainer of GTK+ and the designer
of Pango, I think I'm in a good position to handle coordination of
GNOME with these important core technologies. I also have a strong
interest in language bindings and component technology, as
represented by the CORBA::ORBit Perl bindings for CORBA. If I am
elected to the board, I will continue to push GNOME in the areas of
internationalization and an easy-to-use development platform.&quot;

<P>33. DANIEL VEILLARD. &quot;I am French, a long time Gnomer and
Linux addict, the maintainer of libxml and rpmfind. I work for W3C
and I am used to non-profit organizations and the negociations needed
to get a group to reach consensus. I will focuse on the reuse of
standards, internationalization and keeping trust relationship at an
individual level. I think those are needed to keep hacking on gnome
fun and getting acceptance in new communities.&quot; Affiliated with
