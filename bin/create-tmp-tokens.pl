# Script to create temporary tokens for voters.
#
# How to use this script
# ======================
#
# Look for the elections/referendum id in the database. Like
# "SELECT * FROM elections"
# Look for the current one and remember its id.
#
#
# If don't don't have a row for the current election yet, consider using
# BEGIN; SET NAMES 'utf8';
# INSERT INTO elections (name, voting_start, voting_end, choices_nb, question)
# VALUES ('2010 Spring Board of Directors Election',
#   TIMESTAMP('2009-06-08 00:00:00'), 
#   TIMESTAMP('2009-06-22 23:59:59'),
#   7,
#   'Which candidates would you like to see in the GNOME Foundation Board?');
#
# INSERT INTO election_choices (election_id, choice)
# VALUES ((SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID()), 'Firstname Lastname1'),
# ((SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID()), 'Firstname Lastname2'),
# ((SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID()), 'Youget Theidea');
# And "COMMIT;" if there were no errors. Or "ROLLBACK;" if there were errors.
#
# You should then use this script like this:
# $ ./create-tmp-tokens.pl 1 tokens.txt maildata.txt
#
# where 1 is the elections/referendum id in the database.
#
# tokens.txt now contains SQL statements you can use to create the temporary
# tokens in the database. You can do that with, e.g.
# mysql -h button-back -u username -p foundation < tokens.txt
#
# maildata.txt now contains the data that will be used by mail-instructions.pl
#
# This script assumes, that there is a "electorate" Table which can be a 
# simple VIEW created like this:
# CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW `foundation`.`electorate` AS SELECT  id, firstname, lastname, email FROM `foundation`.`foundationmembers` WHERE DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 2 YEAR) <= foundationmembers.last_renewed_on;
